## üöÄ Quick Start

### Method 1: Download Pre-built Worker (Recommended)

1. Download the latest `worker.js` from [Releases](https://github.com/code3-dev/foxcloud/releases)
2. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   wrangler deploy worker.js
   ```

### Method 2: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/code3-dev/foxcloud.git
cd foxcloud

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
# Copy example configuration and edit:
cp wrangler.example.toml wrangler.toml
# Edit wrangler.toml with your UUIDs and proxy IPs

# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
npm run deploy
```

### Method 3: GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

1. Fork this repository
2. Set up Cloudflare credentials in repository secrets:
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
3. Enable GitHub Actions in repository settings
4. Push to `master` branch to trigger automatic deployment

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

FoxCloud requires the following environment variables to be configured in your Cloudflare Worker:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `UUID` | Comma-separated list of user UUIDs | `08dad8a6-8a6c-4424-9d63-62f3a9bf7f4f,49d598ee-4dfc-4001-95ca-99a5b6002e3c` |
| `PROXY_IP` | Comma-separated list of proxy IPs with ports | `172.66.45.9:443,104.18.128.25:443,162.159.136.94:443` |

See the [Environment Variables Guide](docs/environment-variables.md) for detailed instructions on:
- Generating secure UUIDs
- Validating proxy IPs
- Setting variables via different methods
- Security best practices
- Troubleshooting common issues

See the [Status Page Template](docs/status-page-template.md) for information on implementing a public status page.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Deploy to Cloudflare
npm run deploy
```

## üîß Configuration

### Customizing UUIDs

Generate secure UUIDs using:
```bash
# On Linux/macOS
cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid

# On Windows PowerShell
New-Guid

# Using Node.js
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomUUID())"

# Using FoxCloud helper script
npm run generate-uuid
```

See the [scripts directory](scripts/) for additional utility scripts.

### Proxy IPs

FoxCloud supports multiple proxy IPs for load balancing. Add multiple IPs separated by commas:
```
PROXY_IP = "172.66.45.9:443,104.18.128.25:443,162.159.136.94:443"
```

## üì± Client Configuration

After deployment, access your subscription configuration at:
```
https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/sub
```

See the [Subscription Guide](docs/subscription-guide.md) for detailed instructions on:
- Configuring V2Ray compatible clients
- Setting up mobile clients
- Managing multiple UUIDs
- Troubleshooting connection issues
